### ✅ 📌 KEY INSIGHTS FROM THE BUSINESS REVENUE DASHBOARD

1️⃣ Total Business Performance<br>

The business has a strong revenue base with a good average earning per sale.<br>

2️⃣ Revenue by Region<br>

Asia is the strongest market. The U.K. is performing moderately, and the U.S.A has the lowest revenue — this may need strategic improvement.<br>

3️⃣ Revenue by Country<br>

Countries like:<br>

Singapore<br>
Hong Kong<br>
England<br>
Taiwan<br>

…show very high revenue, while:<br>

Japan<br>
Ohio<br>
Las Vegas<br>
…have comparatively lower numbers.<br>

Meaning:<br>
Revenue is concentrated in a few top-performing countries; expansion opportunities exist in weaker markets.<br>

4️⃣ Revenue by Quarter<br>

Revenue trend across quarters:<br>
QTR 1 is the highest<br>
Then it gradually decreases in QTR 2, QTR 3, and QTR 4<br>
Meaning:<br>
Business performs the best at the beginning of the year, with a steady decline later.<br>
This could be due to seasonality, demand patterns, or marketing slowdown.<br>

5️⃣ Revenue by Month<br>

Revenue is highest in Month 1.<br>
After that, revenue keeps dropping till Month 12.<br>
Average revenue also follows the same pattern.<br>

Meaning:<br>
There are 2 peak revenue months(1 and 11), possibly due to festive or promotional periods.<br>

6️⃣ Revenue by Store / Rank<br>

Store 1 generates the highest revenue.<br>
Store 4 is strong.<br>
Store 3 performs moderately.<br>
Store 5 and Store 2 are the lowest.<br>

Meaning:<br>
Store 1 is the leading performer, while Store 2 and Store 5 may need performance improvement or strategy review.<br>

7️⃣ Revenue by Product<br>

Top product categories include:<br>
Smartphones (highest)<br>
Accessories<br>
Tablets<br>
Laptops (lower)<br>

Meaning:<br>
Smartphones bring the highest sales; laptops generate the least.<br>
The business relies heavily on a few categories.<br>

8️⃣ Sales Rep Performance<br>

All sales reps have the same number of transactions (192).<br>
But their total revenue differs a lot:<br>
Top reps: Dennis, Trevor, Jason, Bryan<br>
Lower reps: Simon W, Emma J., Aron C.<br>

👉 Some sales reps convert better and sell higher-value products.<br>
Training/support may help low performers.<br>

#### ✅ Growth Recommendations<br>

To improve business growth, the company should focus on strengthening low-performing regions like the U.S.A. and the U.K. by introducing targeted marketing and competitive pricing. Since Q1 and Month 1 generate the highest revenue, the business can replicate those seasonal strategies throughout the year.<br>

We should also boost the performance of weaker stores and sales reps through training, performance tracking, and incentive programs. Additionally, expanding high-demand products like smartphones and exploring new profitable markets can help increase overall revenue. By improving weaker areas and maximizing top-performing ones, the business can achieve steady and sustainable growth.
